# PersonalProjects
Projects developed for personal enjoyment

Some of these projects were developed at greatly varying points in time and, consequently, they have varying quality. All of these projects were developed in Python and will therefore require Python to be downloaded on the device attempting to run them. Python can be downloaded here: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Each project can be run individually, although all of them are compiled in the Arcade.py file.
